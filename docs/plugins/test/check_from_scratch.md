# Test plugin: `check_from_scratch`

The `check_from_scratch` test plugin checks that a node can be checked when provisioned from scratch.

Only 1 node per combination of services will be tested by this test plugin, as the goal is to validate the configuration recipes/playbooks by deploying on newly-provisioned nodes for test, and not on the real nodes.
